Better Budget is a personal finance management web application. Upon creating a profile, a user can create models that represent their personal bank accounts. Each bank account can display their transaction history by date, and separate between deposits and other withdrawals. Full CRUD functionality applies to all user bank accounts and transaction models, for ease of use and modularity. 

With a React front end and a Flask/Python back end, this application utilizes PostgreSQL's relational database management system to display user account and transaction history in a neat and organized manner.
